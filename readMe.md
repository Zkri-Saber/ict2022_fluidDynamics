# Fluid Dynamics with Python
### ICT Summer School 2022

Welcome to _Fluid Dynamics with Python_ in ICT Summer School 2022. 
On this course, we will learn the fundamental of fluid dynamics as well as Python programming. In addition, we will also learn Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) by coding solutions to the basic partial differential equations that describe the physics of fluid flow.

### Learning outcomes of the course
This course introduces the fundamentals of fluid dynamics and its practices with Python. The participating students learn the government equations for fluid flow and how to compute them by using jupyterLab. Specifically, the following study aims and competencies are highlighted in this course;
- to increase knowledge about the fundamentals of fluid dynamics
- to increase knowledge about the governing equations for fluid flow 
- to calculate some simplified 2-D fluid flow fields using computational fluid dynamics and jupyterLab.
- to calculate the wind flows in the simplified 2-D city areas using actual map data and meteorological data.
- to acquire Python programming skills for fluid flow calculations


### Prerequisites and co-requisites
Participating students have basic mathematics, such as linear algebra, vector and matrix operations, linear combination, basic multivariate calculus, partial differential equation, etc.
The students preferably have basic programming skills in Python.

## How to use this module

In a regular-session university course, students can complete the **CFD Python** lessons in 4 to 5 weeks. 
As an intensive tutorial, the module can be completed in two or three full days, depending on the learner's prior experience. 
The lessons can also be used for self study. 
In all cases, learners should follow along the worked examples in each lesson by re-typing the code in a fresh Jupyter notebook, maybe taking original notes as they try things out. 

Steps 1–4 are in one spatial dimension. Steps 5–10 are in two dimensions (2D). Steps 11–12 solve the Navier-Stokes equation in 2D. Three "bonus" notebooks cover the CFL condition for numerical stability, array operations with NumPy, and defining functions in Python.
